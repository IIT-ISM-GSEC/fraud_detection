Fraud Detection Module.

Models Used :
1. Custom Fully Connected Neural Network    0.54  (ROC-AUC Score)
2. XGB Classifier (With Smote)              0.68  (ROC-AUC Score)


Using Pretrained Model:

To use the pretrained model (hosted on G-Cloud) follow the steps:

1. Make a new jupyter notebook
2. Make sure to install the requirements.txt in the kernal
3. Import the predict file in the notebook
4. Call the "predict_fraud" function of the predict file while passing the path of the json file of the 10-K form as an argument to the function.

Example Calling:
  
import predict as pre
result=pre.predict_fraud("example_file.json")
print(result)

Tranining The Model:

1.Make sure all the files are pesent in the same directory .
2.Open the notebook "train_and_host_model.ipynb" notebook and run the full notebook.
3. At the last you will get a XGB Classiifer model created in your provided GOOGLE CLOUD Account.
4. Use the goolgle cloud consiole to make a version of your model.
5.Once the model is created you can use the predict script as mentined above to get results.
